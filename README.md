I hail from Russia but I moved to New York about 6 years ago.
I am a  linguist and project manager turned full-stack software engineer, and a graduate of the Grace Hopper Program in NY.
As a (former) project manager, I am passionate about all things related to productivity and collaboration.
I love automating manual and inefficient processes to minimize time spent on repetitive and monotonous work.
